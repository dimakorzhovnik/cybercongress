The goal of this post is to draw a description of cybercongress, of our values and goals.

Points that are covered:
- Who we are
- Our history
- How we do things
- How much progress have we made
- What is unique and impressive about us
- Summary of the most powerful facts

#### We are cybercongress
The blockchain technology has opened the opportunity for development, which was impossible before. We are a sovereign self-funded company of developers, engineers, scientists and craftmens that are creating the basis for a new type of existence. We introduce and experiment with a fundamentally new approach to self-management, and the development of an orientated community towards our set of values and goals.

#### Our history
Our history is still young, but in discussing it, we must make a special mention of cyber•Fund. 
In April 2018 @xhipster, @litvintech and @hleb-albau established a new company. As a result we created an [agreement](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/agreement.md) and explained in it - who we are, for what we stand and our values and goals. This is a very powerful and an important thing that we made for our initiation. 
@xhipster had spend some very exciting and amzaing time with cyber•Fund and we tried to bear in mind the mistakes of the initiation proccess of cyber•Fund. Development of a new agreement from start, with an incredible analysis based on the experience @xhipster had. 

Cyber•Fund was created in November 2013. In November 2015 we developed cyber•Fund: Genesis Agreement. It was one of the first formal charters signed by participants on the Blockchain with proof of existence and a hash of this doc. As you can see, we totally formalized our mission only after two years had passed. In fact, for two years @xhipster didn't know what to do! The second very important point is that they didn't define goals in the Agreement. That's why the movement forward took a while. But, the real big problem that @xhipster sees now, in retrospective, is that the values weren't defined. This had impeded the development of cyber•Fund. That has led to the forks of cyber•Congress from cyber•Fund, and cyber•Academy from cyber•Events. Now we defined our values in the cyber•Congress Agreement, and we hope that the Congress will not repeat  th failures of cyber•Funds past. We're very young, but we have huge experience. Our goals and values aren't just general words. For us - they are direct orders on how to move forward. We clearly define what we need to do and what we absolutely don't need to do. Also, we decided to abandon fiat money, as it is possible to do. And, to abandon third-party money too. We held an investment round inside the team and we managed to "harvest" 582 ETH. It's enough to deliver an MVP over the coming year. If we are wrong, we'll attract another round. Attracting money from the team is a significant motivation for the team to do something and we are glad to see that all the teammates support this initiative.

So what exactly is the Congress? The Congress is a "for profit/non profit" entity. We think that this Hybrid is the first in the industry. It is not a fund, and therefore the Congress has none, and will not have any obligations. It's a self funded entity. The drop model is the following:
  - 60% to delf through pumping tokens under management
  - 20% to Congress members
  - 20% to teams

This is the first incentive model. 
The second one comes into working when a Congress member wants to leave the Congress or the Congress decides to liquidate itself. In those cases:
  - 50% goes to members
  - 25% goes to teams
  - 25% goes to the community
  Namely, 50% of members funds will stay in the Congress and dropping with first model.

#### Our values
We believe that our principles should be aligned with our values, thus helping us to achieve our goals:

- Security. We do not work with fiat or with bureaucratic paper hassle. We work only with digital signatures
- Anonymity and privacy. If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private, it is their right to do so
- Open-source software. Everything we run in production must be open-source
- Open-source hardware. Every piece of hardware that goes into production, must be open-sourced
- Transparency. Transactional transparency is fundamental to community building
- Informational freedom. No local laws can prohibit the flow of any information
- Economic freedom. Nobody has the right to prevent or block transactions
- Free will. We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Engineering is marketing. We would rather spend our resources on engineering then marketing
- Physical liberty. Limitations for physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation. Everything that can be automated, must be automated
- Decentralization. Everything that can be decentralized, shall be decentralized
- Always on the edge. We try to offer alternatives to outdated technologies such as emails

#### Our goals.
Make focus on transactions [e.g cyber-search/cyberd]

We intend to build a strong scientific foundation with self-sustainable community that adhere to our purposes:

  - Provide an abundant access to information proved by transactions for all species
  - Build an incentivization system for open-source communities and creators
  - Make consensus computers more usable, scalable, performant and cheap
  - Develop hardware interfaces and software protocols for ubiquitous, private and uncensored communications across universes
  - Integrate post-quantum cryptography
  - Develop open-source technologies for self-sustainable living
  - Find an open approach for creating self-aware, self-replicating and economically independent robots
  - Create mainstream tools for biological engineering and body augmentations
  - Integrate cybernomics into humans, robots, animals, plants and other thinking formation
  - Demolish all state borders across the universe
  - Find an open approach for creating incentivized and decentralized AI
  - Switch governmentally inclined business models from violent taxing to non-violent
  - Create technologies for accessible space exploration and transportation
  - Create technologies for the transfer of human consciousness to an electronic and digital environment
  - Significantly extend living capabilities for all species up to - but not limited, to 10k years;
  - Create the foundation for thermoregulation and for terraforming the Earth and other nearby planets
  - Build the foundation for the emergence of unified spacetime ownership registry
  - Participate in the development of Metaverse

#### Our team
Here is changeTheWorld oriented team:

@xhipster - architector and visioner. Also cybernomics guru.

@litvintech - creator and experimenter. Also a blockchain husband.

@hleb-albau - developer and engineer. Also the guy who knows how its done.

@asadovka - PM and solver. Also the guy who counts tokens.

@pechalka - JS, frontend and fullstack developer. Also the guy who looks at blockchain with passion and sadness.

@vstavetski - Kotlin and backend developer. Also the guy who likes Honda tuning.

@savetheales - community manager. Also the guy who like tasks on gitcoin.

@olga584 - tech and graph designer. Also a girl.

@arturalbov - Kotlin and Go backend developer. Also the young guy with big ambitions.

Is is fitting to explain the operation processes within our team. As you see - we have no CEO. We think that it is bullshit to delegate all the management tools to one single person. We have 2 of 3 multisignature accounts. It's an agile and a simple way to negotiate.

#### Current project
Here is full stack of our projects:
- [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb) - web3 browser
- [cybernode](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybernode) - client for p2p network
- [cyberd](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd) - protocol for p2p network
- [cyber-search](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-search) - toolchain for transactions parsing and processing
- [cybjs](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb-js) - generic module for web3 developers
- [cyber-markets](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-markets) - toolchain for trades/orders parsing and processing
- [chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear) - the Metaregistry for your registry

Our development process is structured on two-weeks sprints and 4-5 months long blocks. In August 2018 our first block was finished. We have faced with out-of-focus problem and lack of resources as a result. So we have developed a new [roadmap](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/Reports/second-block.md) for the next block with understandable metrics and milestones. So for the next five months we will focus on [cyberd](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd) and [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb). Also, we will focus on [cybernode](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybernode) within the new role.

In addition, we intend to integrate [chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear) in [cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb) as a dapp. Other projects have not been forgotten. They will be developing through our community on [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/). So you're welcome to join.

#### Contacts
According to our values we have decided to use the following communication channels:

- [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybercongress)
- [steemit](https://steemit.com/@cybercongress)
- [twitter](https://twitter.com/cyber_devs)
- [Telegram dev chat](https://t.me/fuckgoogle)
- [Telegram announce channel](https://t.me/cybercongress)

And [github](https://github.com/cybercongress) of course!

#### Summarize
Cyber•Congress is not only about the software. Is not only about hardware, development, blockchain or whatever. It is not only about cybernomics and progress. It about a principal new existence model.

We intend to aim for this with passion and patience, untill our goals will not be achieved. And so on. Probably.

#### What you can find in our blog?
In our blog you will find actual information about the state of the project. Also, you can enjoy our regular column "Top 10 gitcoin tasks" - a report about our work and tutorials. All of this content will be created by our teammates therefore it will be alive, honest and useful.

We will share, not just the dev things, but organization processes and structure too. We will discuss problems and so on.

Enjoy!
