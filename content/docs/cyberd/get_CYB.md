## How to get CYB?

There are 3 ways to get tokens that allow you to participate in testnet either as a validator or as an search agent:

1. **Get it for free**. 1 million Ethereum addresses have been included in the genesis block of cyber protocol based on the ranking defined in paper. You can verify how many tokens had been allocated to your address, by [downloading web3 browser Cyb](https://cyb.ai) and searching for `genesis` there. Our roadmap has several distribution events before the genesis of the mainnet so we will probably expand ways to drop tokens in the future.

2. **Buy OTC**. There is a way to buy CBD tokens from other web3 agents. Go to https://t.me/cybotc group and try to find someone who will sell you some tokens.

3. **Earn through coding**. Go to Gitcoin and [complete a bounty](https://gitcoin.co/profile/cybercongress). For every completed bounty we have a 1B CYB prize tokens, as well as CBD prize.

It is done so for a reason, that acquiring tokens in the testnetwork is difficult. Participation in the testnet requires certain skills from agents. So early participation make sense only for experienced users.

## How to get CBD?

CBD is an [ERC-20 proto token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x136c1121f21c29415D8cd71F8Bb140C7fF187033) that serves a purpose to make CYB distribution more reliable and convinient for investors, and for the developers of the cyber protocol. Based on CBD balances, CYB balances are computed every new testnetwork according to the allocation model in the roadmap. It is much easier to get CBD than CYB, because they can be traded on any Ethereum DEX easily. The drawback of CBD is that you will need to wait for the next phase of development in order to actually use any part of the CBD value in the testnetwork, either as a validator or as an agent. There are several ways to buy CBD tokens:

1. **Buy OTC**. Go to https://t.me/cybotc group and try to find someone who will sell you some CBD tokens.

2. **Buy on Forkdelta**. Go to https://forkdelta.app/#!/trade/0x136c1121f21c29415D8cd71F8Bb140C7fF187033-ETH. Maybe someone is selling some CBD there?

3. **Contribute to the community**. You can wait a bit, until the cyberFoundation formation event. You will be then, able to get some CBD for donating ETH. All ETH donated during the formation event, will become the ownership of the DAO, managed by the contributors.
